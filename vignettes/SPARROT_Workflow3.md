# ü©∫ Spatial Transcriptomics Showcase: Human Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma, Stereo-seq

The pathological tumor size was 21 mm, with evidence of neural, vesicle, and para-pancreatic infiltration.The patient is a 58-year-old male diagnosed with moderately differentiated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) located in the head of the pancreas. Genetic testing revealed a KRAS G12R mutation. To investigate the spatial architecture of the tumor microenvironment, we performed spatial transcriptomic profiling using the **Stereo-seq** on this patient's resected tumor tissue. 100 √ó 100 DNA Nanoballs (DNB) (*bin100*, 50-Œºm diameter) were combined as a pseudo spot, with transcripts of the same gene aggregated within each spot. The SPARROT-formatted object with cell type composition, estimated by *Tangram*, can be downloaded directly from the following link:

### 3. Evaluation of Spatial Co-localization of Plasma Cells with *ADA2* Expression and Memory B Cells with *CD27* Expression

```r

```
```r
#> fitting ...

#> 1 0.3823684      0 0.2363755         0 0.1575453     0
```
```r
computeGeneCelltypeOverlap(cc, "CD27", "Bm")
```
```r
#> fitting ...
#> |================================================================================================| 100%

```
> **Interpretation**:  *ADA2* shows spatial overlap with Plasma Cells.
> All permutation p-values are statistically significant (p < 0.001), indicating that
> *ADA2* expression is non-randomly enriched in spatial locations occupied by Plasma Cells.
> The positive MCC further supports a true spatial association, suggesting that *ADA2*‚Å∫ PCs may represent a
> distinct spatial or functional subpopulation within the tissue.
> 
> **Interpretation**:  *CD27* exhibits spatial co-localization with Memory B cells (Bm).
> All overlap metrics are statistically significant (p < 0.001), supporting a non-random spatial relationship.
> The positive MCC further indicates that *CD27*‚Å∫ expression is preferentially enriched in Bm-dominated regions,
> consistent with *CD27* being a canonical marker for Memory B cells.

### 4. Joint Binarized Spatial Domains of *ADA2*‚Å∫ Plasma and *CD27*‚Å∫ Memory B Cells
To investigate spatial interactions between *ADA2*‚Å∫ plasma cells and *CD27*‚Å∫ memory B cells, we first binarized gene expression using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based thresholding. We then defined four spatially restricted subpopulations: *ADA2*‚Å∫ and *ADA2*‚Åª plasma cells, and *CD27*‚Å∫ and *CD27*‚Åª memory B cells. Spatial distributions of these subpopulations were visualized, and their proximity was quantified using a bidirectional nearest-neighbor distance metric to assess potential lineage relationships or spatial associations.
```r
# Binarize ADA2 expression using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
ADA2_bin = as.logical(binarizeByGMM(cc@expr["ADA2",]))

# Define ADA2-positive plasma cells (ADA2‚Å∫ PC) by intersecting ADA2‚Å∫ and plasma cell annotations
ADA2pos_PC = as.logical(cc@meta.data$bin_PC)
ADA2pos_PC[!ADA2_bin] = FALSE

# Define ADA2-negative plasma cells (ADA2‚Åª PC) by excluding ADA2‚Å∫ from plasma cells
ADA2neg_PC = as.logical(cc@meta.data$bin_PC)
ADA2neg_PC[ADA2_bin] = FALSE

# Store binary indicators in metadata
cc@meta.data$bin_ADA2pos_PC = as.numeric(ADA2pos_PC)
cc@meta.data$bin_ADA2neg_PC = as.numeric(ADA2neg_PC)

# Repeat the same procedure for CD27 expression and memory B cells
CD27_bin = as.logical(binarizeByGMM(cc@expr["CD27",]))

# Define CD27-positive memory B cells (CD27‚Å∫ Bm)
CD27pos_Bm = as.logical(cc@meta.data$bin_Bm)
CD27pos_Bm[!CD27_bin] = FALSE

# Define CD27-negative memory B cells (CD27‚Åª Bm)
CD27neg_Bm = as.logical(cc@meta.data$bin_Bm)
CD27neg_Bm[CD27_bin] = FALSE

# Store binary indicators in metadata
cc@meta.data$bin_CD27pos_Bm = as.numeric(CD27pos_Bm)
cc@meta.data$bin_CD27neg_Bm = as.numeric(CD27neg_Bm)

# Visualize the spatial distribution of each subpopulation
plotCellType(cc, celltype = "ADA2pos_PC") + coord_fixed()
plotCellType(cc, celltype = "ADA2neg_PC") + coord_fixed()
plotCellType(cc, celltype = "CD27pos_Bm") + coord_fixed()
plotCellType(cc, celltype = "CD27neg_Bm") + coord_fixed()

```
<img src="https://github.com/bio-Pixel/SPARROT/blob/main/vignettes/PUMCH_D2_ADA2_CD27cell.png?raw=true" width="1000"/>

We compared the spatial overlap between CD27‚Å∫ memory B cells and ADA2‚Å∫ or ADA2‚Åª plasma cells.

```r
evaluate_overlap_metrics(bin1 = cc@meta.data$bin_CD27pos_Bm,
                         bin2 = cc@meta.data$bin_ADA2pos_PC,
                         coords = cc@coords)
```
```r
#>       dice p_dice  jaccard p_jaccard      mcc p_mcc
#>1 0.4753053      0 0.311738         0 0.315965     0
```
```r
evaluate_overlap_metrics(bin1 = cc@meta.data$bin_CD27pos_Bm,
                         bin2 = cc@meta.data$bin_ADA2neg_PC,
                         coords = cc@coords)
```
```r
#>       dice p_dice   jaccard p_jaccard        mcc p_mcc
#>1 0.2381575      1 0.1351753         1 -0.2510521     1
```
> **Interpretation**:  Spatial overlap metrics revealed that *CD27*‚Å∫ memory B cells are significantly co-localized with *ADA2*‚Å∫ plasma cells (Dice = 0.48, MCC = 0.32, p < 0.001), while showing no overlap and even spatial exclusion with *ADA2*‚Åª plasma cells (MCC = ‚Äì0.25, p = 1), supporting a local differentiation origin of *ADA2*‚Å∫ plasma cells within the immune microenvironment.

### 5. Spatial Distance between Binary Features (*CD27*‚Å∫ Bm to *ADA2*‚Å∫/*ADA2*‚Åª PC)
The *evaluate_bidirectional_nn_distance()* function calculates the bidirectional nearest-neighbor (NN) distance between two sets of spatially localized binary features (e.g., cell type presence or gene expression). It is used to assess spatial proximity rather than direct overlap. This method provides a robust spatial distance metric between two binary masks (e.g., bin1, bin2), such as two cell types or a gene and a cell type.

```r
d1 = evaluate_bidirectional_nn_distance(bin1 = cc2@meta.data$bin_CD27pos_Bm,
                                        bin2 = cc2@meta.data$bin_ADA2pos_PC,
                                        coords = cc2@coords)

d2 = evaluate_bidirectional_nn_distance(bin1 = cc2@meta.data$bin_CD27pos_Bm,
                                        bin2 = cc2@meta.data$bin_ADA2neg_PC,
                                        coords = cc2@coords)
df = rbind(data.frame(mean = d1$nn1to2$mean_nn1to2_bin, sd = d1$nn1to2$sd_nn1to2_bin, type = "ADA2+ PC"),
           data.frame(mean = d2$nn1to2$mean_nn1to2_bin, sd = d2$nn1to2$sd_nn1to2_bin, type = "ADA2- PC"))

library(ggpubr)
library(ggthemes)
p = wilcox.test(d1$nn1to2$distance, d2$nn2to1$distance)$p.value
p
#[1] 1.329531e-207
compare_df <- data.frame(
  group1 = "ADA2+ PC",
  group2 = "ADA2- PC",
  y.position = 4, 
  p.adj = p,
  p.format = "****" 
)

ggplot()+
  geom_bar(data = df, aes(x = type, y = mean, fill = type), stat = 'identity', width = 0.35)+
  geom_errorbar(data = df, aes(x = type, y = mean, ymin = mean-sd, ymax = mean+sd), width = 0.15)+
  stat_pvalue_manual(compare_df, 
                     label = "p.format", 
                     tip.length = 0.05)+
  ylab("Distance (Avg. ¬± sd)")+ xlab(NULL)+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
<img src="https://github.com/bio-Pixel/SPARROT/blob/main/vignettes/PUMCH_D2_CD27_ADA2_dist.png?raw=true" width="200"/>
*P*-value was calculated by the Mann-Whitney U test. ****, *P* < 0.0001.
> **Interpretation**: *ADA2*‚Å∫ PCs exhibit significantly shorter distances to *CD27*‚Å∫ Bm compared to ADA2‚Åª PCs.
