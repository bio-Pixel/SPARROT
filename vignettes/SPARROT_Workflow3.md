# ü©∫ Spatial Transcriptomics Showcase: Human Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma, Stereo-seq

The pathological tumor size was 21 mm, with evidence of neural, vesicle, and para-pancreatic infiltration.The patient is a 58-year-old male diagnosed with moderately differentiated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) located in the head of the pancreas. Genetic testing revealed a KRAS G12R mutation. To investigate the spatial architecture of the tumor microenvironment, we performed spatial transcriptomic profiling using the **Stereo-seq** on this patient's resected tumor tissue. 100 √ó 100 DNA Nanoballs (DNB) (*bin100*, 50-Œºm diameter) were combined as a pseudo spot, with transcripts of the same gene aggregated within each spot. The SPARROT-formatted object with cell type composition, estimated by *Tangram*, can be downloaded directly from the following link:

### 3. Evaluation of Spatial Co-localization of Plasma Cells with *ADA2* Expression and Memory B Cells with *CD27* Expression

```r
computeGeneCelltypeOverlap(cc, "ADA2", "PC")
```
```r
#> fitting ...
#>  |================================================================================================| 100%
#>       dice p_dice   jaccard p_jaccard       mcc p_mcc
#> 1 0.3823684      0 0.2363755         0 0.1575453     0
```
```r
computeGeneCelltypeOverlap(cc, "CD27", "Bm")
```
```r

```
> **Interpretation**:  *ADA2* shows spatial overlap with Plasma Cells.
> All permutation p-values are statistically significant (p < 0.001), indicating that
> *ADA2* expression is non-randomly enriched in spatial locations occupied by Plasma Cells.
> The positive MCC further supports a true spatial association, suggesting that *ADA2*‚Å∫ PCs may represent a
> distinct spatial or functional subpopulation within the tissue.
> 
> **Interpretation**:  *CD27* exhibits spatial co-localization with Memory B cells (Bm).
> All overlap metrics are statistically significant (p < 0.001), supporting a non-random spatial relationship.
> The positive MCC further indicates that *CD27*‚Å∫ expression is preferentially enriched in Bm-dominated regions,
> consistent with *CD27* being a canonical marker for Memory B cells.

### 4. Joint Binarized Spatial Domains of *ADA2*‚Å∫ Plasma and *CD27*‚Å∫ Memory B Cells
To investigate spatial interactions between *ADA2*‚Å∫ plasma cells and *CD27*‚Å∫ memory B cells, we first binarized gene expression using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based thresholding. We then defined four spatially restricted subpopulations: *ADA2*‚Å∫ and *ADA2*‚Åª plasma cells, and *CD27*‚Å∫ and *CD27*‚Åª memory B cells. Spatial distributions of these subpopulations were visualized, and their proximity was quantified using a bidirectional nearest-neighbor distance metric to assess potential lineage relationships or spatial associations.
```r
# Binarize ADA2 expression using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
ADA2_bin = as.logical(binarizeByGMM(cc@expr["ADA2",]))

# Define ADA2-positive plasma cells (ADA2‚Å∫ PC) by intersecting ADA2‚Å∫ and plasma cell annotations
ADA2pos_PC = as.logical(cc@meta.data$bin_PC)
ADA2pos_PC[!ADA2_bin] = FALSE

# Define ADA2-negative plasma cells (ADA2‚Åª PC) by excluding ADA2‚Å∫ from plasma cells
ADA2neg_PC = as.logical(cc@meta.data$bin_PC)
ADA2neg_PC[ADA2_bin] = FALSE

# Store binary indicators in metadata
cc@meta.data$bin_ADA2pos_PC = as.numeric(ADA2pos_PC)
cc@meta.data$bin_ADA2neg_PC = as.numeric(ADA2neg_PC)

# Repeat the same procedure for CD27 expression and memory B cells
CD27_bin = as.logical(binarizeByGMM(cc@expr["CD27",]))

# Define CD27-positive memory B cells (CD27‚Å∫ Bm)
CD27pos_Bm = as.logical(cc@meta.data$bin_Bm)
CD27pos_Bm[!CD27_bin] = FALSE

# Define CD27-negative memory B cells (CD27‚Åª Bm)
CD27neg_Bm = as.logical(cc@meta.data$bin_Bm)
CD27neg_Bm[CD27_bin] = FALSE

# Store binary indicators in metadata
cc@meta.data$bin_CD27pos_Bm = as.numeric(CD27pos_Bm)
cc@meta.data$bin_CD27neg_Bm = as.numeric(CD27neg_Bm)

# Visualize the spatial distribution of each subpopulation
plotCellType(cc, celltype = "ADA2pos_PC") + coord_fixed()
plotCellType(cc, celltype = "ADA2neg_PC") + coord_fixed()
plotCellType(cc, celltype = "CD27pos_Bm") + coord_fixed()
plotCellType(cc, celltype = "CD27neg_Bm") + coord_fixed()

```

We compared the spatial overlap between CD27‚Å∫ memory B cells and ADA2‚Å∫ or ADA2‚Åª plasma cells.

```r
evaluate_overlap_metrics(bin1 = cc@meta.data$bin_CD27pos_Bm,
                         bin2 = cc@meta.data$bin_ADA2pos_PC,
                         coords = cc@coords)
```
```r
#>       dice p_dice  jaccard p_jaccard      mcc p_mcc
#>1 0.4753053      0 0.311738         0 0.315965     0
```
```r
evaluate_overlap_metrics(bin1 = cc@meta.data$bin_CD27pos_Bm,
                         bin2 = cc@meta.data$bin_ADA2neg_PC,
                         coords = cc@coords)
```
```r
#>       dice p_dice   jaccard p_jaccard        mcc p_mcc
#>1 0.2381575      1 0.1351753         1 -0.2510521     1
```
> **Interpretation**:  Spatial overlap metrics revealed that *CD27*‚Å∫ memory B cells are significantly co-localized with *ADA2*‚Å∫ plasma cells (Dice = 0.48, MCC = 0.32, p < 0.001), while showing no overlap and even spatial exclusion with *ADA2*‚Åª plasma cells (MCC = ‚Äì0.25, p = 1), supporting a local differentiation origin of *ADA2*‚Å∫ plasma cells within the immune microenvironment.

### 6. Evaluation of Spatial Co-localization of Cardiomyocytes with Gene Expression

```r
computeGeneCelltypeOverlap(cc, gene = "RYR2", celltype = "Fibroblast")
```
```r
#>fitting ...
#>  |===================================================================================================================| 100%
#>       dice p_dice   jaccard p_jaccard        mcc p_mcc
#>1 0.3614404      1 0.2205842         1 -0.3097191     1
```

> **Interpretation**: The spatial expression of *RYR2* shows only modest overlap with *Fibroblasts*  
> (*Dice* = 0.36), and all p-values are non-significant (*p* = 1), suggesting that *RYR2* is likely expressed  
> in regions that are **spatially distinct** from *Fibroblast*-enriched areas.

```r
computeGeneCelltypeOverlap(cc, gene = "PDGFRA", celltype = "Fibroblast")
```
```r
#>fitting ...
#>  |===================================================================================================================| 100%
#>       dice p_dice   jaccard p_jaccard      mcc p_mcc
#>1 0.5524716      0 0.3816654         0 0.231789     0
```

> **Interpretation**: The expression of *PDGFRA* exhibits a **significant spatial colocalization**  
> with *Fibroblasts* (*Dice* = 0.55, *p* < 0.001), indicating that *PDGFRA* may mark or functionally associate  
> with *Fibroblast* populations in this tissue context.
