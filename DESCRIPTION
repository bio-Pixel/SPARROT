Description: SPARROT provides tools to quantify and visualize the spatial proximity, overlap, and transcriptomic relationships between cell types in spatial transcriptomics data. It supports Seurat integration, cell probability binarization, overlap metrics with permutation testing, nearest-neighbor distance analysis, and flexible multi-celltype visualization.
